Users can connect flights via:
- **📱 Boarding Pass Scanner**: IATA barcode (BCBP format) + OCR
- **🍎 Apple Wallet Sync**: Extract passes from iOS Wallet
- **📅 Google Calendar**: Parse flight events
- **✍️ Manual Entry**: Direct input of flight details

**Status**: ✅ **Fully Implemented**

---

### **2. Real-Time Flight Tracking** ✅⚠️

#### **What's Built**:
```dart
// lib/services/cirium_flight_tracking_service.dart
class CiriumFlightTrackingService {
  ✅ Verify flights from boarding pass data
  ✅ Poll Cirium API every 2 minutes for updates
  ✅ Detect flight phase changes (8 phases)
  ✅ Stream updates to UI via FlightTrackingModel
  ✅ Extract operational context (delays, gate changes, weather)
  ✅ Handle both real-time & historical flights
}
```

#### **Flight Phases Tracked**:
1. **Pre-Check-In** (48h before departure)
2. **Check-In** (24h - departure)
3. **Boarding** (Gate arrival)
4. **Taxi Out** (Pushback)
5. **In-Flight** (Takeoff)
6. **Taxi In** (Landing)
7. **Arrived** (Gate arrival)
8. **Completed** (Baggage claim)

#### **Status**: ✅ **Core Engine Complete** | ⚠️ **Polling Needs Live Testing**

**What Works**:
- ✅ API integration with Cirium (real-time + historical)
- ✅ Flight phase detection logic
- ✅ State management via Riverpod
- ✅ Event stream for UI updates

**What Needs Testing**:
- ⚠️ Live flight tracking with actual in-progress flights
- ⚠️ Phase transition accuracy during real flights
- ⚠️ API rate limiting (currently polls every 2 min)
- ⚠️ Battery optimization for long-haul flights

---

### **3. Stage-Based Micro-Feedback System** ✅

#### **Concept**: 
Instead of one post-flight review, collect **bite-sized feedback** at each flight stage.

#### **Implementation**:
```dart
// lib/models/stage_feedback_model.dart
class StageFeedback {
  ✅ Stage-specific timestamps
  ✅ Positive/negative selections (tags)
  ✅ Custom feedback text
  ✅ 1-5 star rating
  ✅ Emoji reactions
  ✅ Optional comments
}
```

#### **User Flow**:
1. **Notification Trigger**: Phase change detected → Push notification sent
2. **Quick Feedback Modal**: User taps notification → Micro-review sheet opens
3. **Simple Input**: Star rating + emoji + optional comment (< 30 seconds)
4. **Local Storage**: Saved to `stageFeedbackProvider`
5. **Supabase Sync**: Immediately uploaded to `stage_feedback` table

#### **Status**: ✅ **Fully Built** | ⚠️ **Needs Real Flight Testing**

**What Works**:
- ✅ Beautiful micro-review modal UI (`micro_review_modal.dart`)
- ✅ Stage-specific questions per flight phase
- ✅ Local state management
- ✅ Supabase integration
- ✅ Notification service ready

**What's Missing**:
- ⚠️ Automatic notification triggering on phase change (needs testing)
- ⚠️ Deep linking from notification → specific stage feedback screen
- ⚠️ Background tracking when app is closed

---

### **4. Push Notifications** ✅⚠️

#### **Implementation**:
```dart
// lib/services/flight_notification_service.dart
class FlightNotificationService {
  ✅ iOS + Android local notifications
  ✅ Flight phase change alerts
  ✅ Custom notification payloads (PNR + stage)
  ✅ Permission handling
  ✅ Notification tapping → navigation
}
```

#### **Notification Examples**:
- 🛫 **Boarding**: "Your flight BA123 is boarding! How's the gate area?"
- ✈️ **In-Flight**: "You're in the air! How's your flight experience so far?"
- 🛬 **Landed**: "Welcome to JFK! How was your flight?"

#### **Status**: ✅ **Infrastructure Ready** | ⚠️ **Needs Real Device Testing**

**Challenges**:
- Background execution limits (iOS WorkManager, Android Workmanager)
- Deep linking not fully wired up
- Battery optimization testing needed

---

### **5. My Journey - Live Timeline** ✅

#### **Features**:
```dart
// lib/screen/journey/my_journey_screen.dart
✅ Real-time flight phase display
✅ Journey events timeline (gate changes, delays)
✅ Tap events to add micro-feedback
✅ Completed flights archive
✅ Empty state with "Connect Your Flight" CTA
```

#### **Timeline Events**:
- ✈️ Trip Added (boarding pass scanned)

- ✅ **Actionable**: Airlines can respond to issues mid-flight
- ✅ **Contextual**: Includes operational data (delays, weather, gate changes)

### **Data Flow**:
```
1. Boarding Pass Scan → Cirium Verification → Journey Created
                              ↓
2. Real-Time Tracking Starts (2-min polling)
                              ↓
3. Phase Change Detected → Push Notification Sent
                              ↓
4. User Opens App → Micro-Review Modal → 30-sec feedback
                              ↓
5. Feedback Saved → Supabase → Available to airlines
                              ↓
6. Flight Completes → Aggregate All Stages → Final Review
```

### **Unique Value**:
- **For Passengers**: Express concerns immediately, get heard
- **For Airlines**: Real-time intelligence, fix issues on the fly

## 🧠 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### **What's Working**:
- ✅ The core concept is **innovative and defensible**
- ✅ Technical foundation is **solid and scalable**
- ✅ UI/UX is **premium and polished**
- ✅ Data architecture is **well-designed**
- ✅ Cirium integration is **production-ready**

### **What's Risky**:
- ⚠️ **Unproven demand**: Will users actually submit micro-reviews?
- ⚠️ **Notification fatigue**: 8 notifications per flight might annoy
- ⚠️ **Battery drain**: 10-hour flights with 2-min polling
- ⚠️ **Cold start problem**: Need reviews to attract users
- ⚠️ **Cirium costs**: High API usage could get expensive

### **What to Pivot On**:
- 💡 **If consumers don't engage**: Pivot to B2B (airlines only)
- 💡 **If battery is an issue**: Switch to manual check-ins per phase
- 💡 **If notifications annoy**: Make them opt-in per stage
- 💡 **If costs are high**: Cache more data, reduce polling frequency
