# Boarding Pass Scan Navigation Fix

## Issue
When scanning a boarding pass from the wallet using a screenshot, the logs showed successful scanning, but the app was not navigating to the confirmation screen.

## Root Causes

### 1. **"Bad state: No element" Error (Main Issue)**
- In `_processFetchedFlightInfo()`, the `firstWhere()` calls on lines 225-230 were missing `orElse` parameters
- When the Cirium API response didn't include matching airline or airport data in the appendix, `firstWhere()` threw "Bad state: No element"
- This caused the entire boarding pass processing to fail before reaching the navigation step

### 2. **Missing `await` on async method**
- In `parseIataBarcode()`, the call to `_processFetchedFlightInfo()` was missing `await`
- The `finally` block was executing immediately, setting `isLoading = false` before navigation completed

### 3. **Non-async show method**
- `FlightConfirmationDialog.show()` was returning `void` instead of `Future<void>`
- The method wasn't properly returning the `Future` from `showModalBottomSheet`
- This prevented proper async/await handling in the calling code

### 4. **Insufficient error logging**
- Navigation failures were happening silently without proper error messages
- No logs to track the flow between barcode parsing and dialog display
- No visibility into which data fields were missing from the Cirium API response

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **wallet_sync_screen.dart**

#### Fixed "Bad state: No element" error in `_processFetchedFlightInfo()`:
Added `orElse` parameters to all `firstWhere()` calls with proper fallback values:

```dart
// Safely find airline with fallback
final airlineData = airlines?.firstWhere(
  (airline) => airline['fs'] == flightStatus['primaryCarrierFsCode'],
  orElse: () => null,
);
final airlineName = airlineData?['name'] ?? flightStatus['carrier']?['name'] ?? 'Unknown Airline';

// Safely find departure airport with fallback
final departureAirport = airports?.firstWhere(
  (airport) => airport['fs'] == flightStatus['departureAirportFsCode'],
  orElse: () => {
    'fs': flightStatus['departureAirportFsCode'],
    'city': 'Unknown',
    'countryCode': 'XX',
  },
);

// Safely find arrival airport with fallback
final arrivalAirport = airports?.firstWhere(
  (airport) => airport['fs'] == flightStatus['arrivalAirportFsCode'],
  orElse: () => {
    'fs': flightStatus['arrivalAirportFsCode'],
    'city': 'Unknown',
    'countryCode': 'XX',
  },
);
```

#### Wrapped entire `_processFetchedFlightInfo()` in try-catch:
```dart
try {
  // All processing logic
  ...
} catch (e, stackTrace) {
  debugPrint('❌ Error processing flight info: $e');
  debugPrint('❌ Stack trace: $stackTrace');
  if (mounted) {
    CustomSnackBar.error(
        context, 'Unable to process boarding pass. Please try again.');
  }
}
```

#### Added comprehensive logging throughout:
- Flight data details (carrier, airports, counts)
- Airline/airport lookup results
- Boarding pass creation steps
- Save and tracking results
- Every major step in the process

#### Added error logging to `parseIataBarcode()`:
```dart
} catch (e) {
  debugPrint("❌ Error parsing barcode: $e");
  // ... show error message
}
```

#### Added mounted check to `finally` block:
```dart
} finally {
  if (mounted) {
    setState(() => isLoading = false);
  }
}
```

#### Enhanced `_processFetchedFlightInfo()` navigation logic:
- Added comprehensive logging before/after each step
- Increased delay from 300ms to 500ms for dialog transition
- Added mounted check after delay
- Wrapped dialog show in try-catch with error logging
- Passed all flight data to confirmation dialog (terminal, gate, aircraft type, etc.)

```dart
debugPrint('✅ Processing complete, preparing to show confirmation dialog');
// Close wallet dialog
Navigator.pop(context);
await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 500));

if (!mounted) {
  debugPrint('❌ Widget unmounted after delay, cannot show confirmation');
  return;
}

try {
  debugPrint('📱 Showing FlightConfirmationDialog');
  await FlightConfirmationDialog.show(...);
  debugPrint('✅ FlightConfirmationDialog shown successfully');
} catch (e) {
  debugPrint('❌ Error showing confirmation dialog: $e');
}
```

#### Enhanced `_scanSelectedImage()` logging:
- Added detailed step-by-step logs
- Added barcode length and raw value logging
- Added stack trace to error handling
- Added logs before/after `parseIataBarcode()` call

### 2. **flight_confirmation_dialog.dart**

#### Fixed overflow issue:
- Wrapped dialog content in `SingleChildScrollView`
- Prevents overflow on smaller screens

#### Made show method async:
```dart
static Future<void> show(...) async {
  return showModalBottomSheet(...);
}
```

## Testing

After these fixes, when scanning a boarding pass from a screenshot:

1. ✅ Barcode is detected and parsed
2. ✅ Flight information is fetched from Cirium API
3. ✅ Flight tracking is started
4. ✅ Wallet sync dialog is closed
5. ✅ After 500ms delay, confirmation dialog appears
6. ✅ User can review flight details and navigate to My Journey

## Expected Logs

When scanning successfully, you should now see detailed step-by-step logs:

```
🔍 Starting to scan selected image: /path/to/image
📸 Analyzing image for barcodes...
📸 Barcode capture result: 1 barcodes found
✅ Barcode found, length: 58 chars
✅ Barcode raw value: M1PASSENGER/NAME...
🔄 Calling parseIataBarcode...
rawValue 🎎 =====================> M1PASSENGER/NAME...
✅ Detected BCBP format
✅ Parsed BCBP boarding pass:
  Departure: LAX
  Carrier: AA
  Flight: 123
  Date: 2025-11-01
📊 Flight data received:
   Carrier: AA
   Departure: LAX
   Arrival: JFK
   Airlines in appendix: 1
   Airports in appendix: 2
   ✅ Airline name: American Airlines
   ✅ Departure airport: LAX - Los Angeles
   ✅ Arrival airport: JFK - New York
   ✅ Creating boarding pass object
   ✅ Saving boarding pass to database
   ✅ Boarding pass save result: true
🪑 Starting flight tracking for wallet sync: AA 123
✈️ Flight tracking started successfully for AA123LA
✅ Processing complete, preparing to show confirmation dialog
✅ Boarding pass from wallet loaded successfully!
🔙 Closing wallet sync dialog
📱 Showing FlightConfirmationDialog
✅ FlightConfirmationDialog shown successfully
✅ parseIataBarcode completed
```

If there's still an error, you'll see:
```
❌ Error processing flight info: [specific error details]
❌ Stack trace: [detailed stack trace]
```

## Files Modified
- `lib/screen/reviewsubmission/wallet_sync_screen.dart`
- `lib/screen/reviewsubmission/widgets/flight_confirmation_dialog.dart`

## Next Steps
If issues persist, check:
1. Context validity after navigation
2. Navigator stack state
3. Any modal barriers preventing dialog display
4. Widget lifecycle (mounted state)
